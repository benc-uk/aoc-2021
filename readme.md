# Advent Of Code 2021

My attempt at Advent of Code 2021, written in Go using a lot of brute force and ignorance

https://adventofcode.com/2021

## Usage

Use make and set the `DAY` variable to what ever day you are running or testing, default day is 1.

```bash
make test
make test DAY=2
```

All tests should pass, they are run on the example input rather than the full input

To get the real answers use `make run`, for example for day 4

```bash
make run DAY=4
